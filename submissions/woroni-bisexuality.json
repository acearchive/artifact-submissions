  "summary": "An article from an Australian student magazine discussing bisexuality and whether it could be better understood as a form of asexuality.",
  "description": "This article describes a Gay Liberation meeting discussion about bisexuality, where one participant said, \"I've been listening to the discussion and am starting to wonder whether bisexuality is not essentially asexual. By that I mean that it is without predisposition on the basis of the sex of the other personâ€¦ that the whole of the human race is available and, whatever the individual whom we light upon, sex will be the expression of the love.\"",
