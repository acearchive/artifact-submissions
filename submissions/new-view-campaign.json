  "summary": "The New View Campaign was a US-based movement which aimed to challenge the increasing medicalisation of female sexuality and sex characteristics.",
  "description": "From the late 90s onwards, the US experienced a boom in surgical and pharmaceutical interventions into female sex and sexuality, including the search for a \"female Viagra\". In response, sex therapist Leonore Tiefer convened a group of feminists and clinicians and formed the New View Campaign, which sought to promote sex education and prevent the approval of supposed desire enhancing drugs such as Intrinsa and Flibanserin. The New View Campaign was active from 2000-2016. The medicalisation of perceived low desire, or Hypoactive Sexual Desire Dysfunction (HSDD), is closely associated with the medicalisation of asexuality.",
