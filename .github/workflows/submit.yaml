      # artifact-submit-action uses git to determine which artifacts have
      # changed and need to be validated/uploaded. We parameterize this here so
      # that we can accept it as a workflow_dispatch input in the other
      # workflows. That way, if we ever need to manually kick off one of those
      # workflows, we can specify the base branch and therefore exactly which
      # artifacts need to be validated/uploaded.
