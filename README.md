# artifact-submissions

ðŸš§ This repository is under construction. ðŸš§

This repository is where submissions to add or modify artifacts in [Ace
Archive](https://acearchive.lgbt) are collected for manual review.

Each submission is a JSON file in the [submissions/](./submissions/) directory
generated by a form on Ace Archive.

When a PR is opened, the GitHub Action in
[acearchive/artifact-submit-action](https://github.com/acearchive/artifact-submit-action)
validates that the JSON submission files match the expected schema.

When a PR is merged, that same action uploads the linked files to Ace Archive.
Additionally,
[acearchive/hugo-artifact-action](https://github.com/acearchive/hugo-artifact-action)
is used to automatically generate static assets from the artifact submissions
which are used to build the static site.
