# artifact-submissions

ðŸš§ This repository is under construction. ðŸš§

This repository is where submissions to add or modify artifacts in [Ace
Archive](https://acearchive.lgbt) are collected for manual review.

Each submission is a JSON file in the [submissions/](./submissions/) directory
generated by a form on Ace Archive.

When a PR is opened, the GitHub Action in
[acearchive/artifact-submit-action](https://github.com/acearchive/artifact-submit-action)
validates that the JSON submission files match the expected schema.

When a PR is merged, that same action downloads the files linked in the
submission from the included URLs, validates their hashes against the included
checksums, and if the checksums match, uploads them to Cloudflare R2 and uploads
the metadata to Cloudflare KV.

Double-checking the hashes before uploading them to R2 ensures that the files
returned from the included URLs have not changed since they were manually
reviewed.
